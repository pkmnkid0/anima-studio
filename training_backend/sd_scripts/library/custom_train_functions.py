class _QMCSequenceManager:
    """Manages low-discrepancy (quasi-random) sequences for timestep sampling.

    Sobol and Halton sequences are deterministic low-discrepancy sequences that
    fill the unit interval more uniformly than pseudo-random numbers, yielding
    faster convergence of Monte Carlo estimates (variance ~O((log B)^d / B^d)
    vs ~O(1/B) for iid). Unlike stratified sampling (which resets every batch),
    a QMC sequence advances across batches so that over many steps the entire
    timestep range is covered with minimal discrepancy.

    The manager keeps a global draw counter so consecutive calls produce
    *different* points (the sequence does not restart at 0 each batch). A
    scrambled Sobol engine is used for randomization, which preserves the
    low-discrepancy property while allowing unbiased error estimation.

    Multi-GPU (DDP) support
    ------------------------
    Each DDP rank is a separate Python process with its own class-level
    ``_instances`` dict. If every rank used the same ``seed`` they would all
    draw the *identical* sequence, so the combined effective batch would be the
    same ``batch_size`` points repeated ``num_processes`` times — destroying the
    low-discrepancy property across the DDP dimension. To avoid this, callers
    pass ``rank`` (the DDP process index); the manager offsets the scramble
    seed by ``rank`` so each rank draws from a *different* scrambled sequence.
    Scrambling preserves the low-discrepancy property of each individual
    sequence, so every rank still gets a space-filling set of points, and the
    combined batch across ranks has no duplicate points. (This is simpler and
    more robust than fast-forwarding a single global sequence, which would
    require the total draw count to remain a power of two for Sobol's balance
    properties.)

    Supported methods:
        "sobol":  Scrambled Sobol sequence (torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine).
        "halton": Halton sequence (scipy.stats.qmc.Halton, scrambled).
        "sobol_jittered": Sobol sequence used as within-stratum jitter; each
            batch of ``n`` draws is placed one point per equal stratum of
            [0,1] (strata assignment randomly permuted), combining per-batch
            stratified coverage with low-discrepancy jitter across batches.
        "halton_jittered": Same, with a Halton sequence as the jitter source.

    Sobol base-2 alignment
    ----------------------
    Sobol sequences only have their optimal balance (low-discrepancy)
    properties when the *total* number of generated points is a power of two.
    When a draw of ``n = 2**m`` points is requested and the running total is
    not a multiple of ``n``, the manager first draws and discards
    ``(-total) % n`` padding points so every batch is a balanced base-2 block.
    Padding is counted in ``_draw_count`` so checkpoint save/resume fast-forward
    reproduces the exact same sequence position.

    Note on performance
    -------------------
    Both Sobol (``torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine``) and Halton (``scipy.stats.qmc``)
    generate points on the CPU; the result is then moved to the target device.
    For typical batch sizes (1-32) this host->device transfer is negligible, but
    it is a per-step sync point. There is no native CUDA Sobol/Halton generator
    in torch, so this cost is unavoidable with the current engines.

    Variance-reduction methods (precedence order is ``antithetic`` then
    ``qmc`` then ``stratified``; antithetic and qmc compose, see below):

    * ``antithetic=True``: the base randomness is drawn as mirrored pairs
      ((z, -z) for logit_normal, (u, 1-u) for mode/uniform) before applying the
      same deterministic transform, preserving the marginal distribution while
      reducing sampling variance. Most effective at small batch sizes (4-8).
      Odd batch sizes are handled by truncating the last mirrored pair.

    * ``qmc="sobol"|"halton"``: use a low-discrepancy (quasi-random) sequence for
      the base uniform. These sequences fill [0,1] more uniformly than
      pseudo-random numbers, yielding faster convergence than iid (and often
      better than stratified at moderate batch sizes). The sequence advances
      across batches via a global counter, so over many steps the entire
      timestep range is covered with minimal discrepancy. Composes with the
      deterministic distribution transform and any shift.

    * ``stratified=True``: the unit interval is partitioned into ``batch_size``
      equal strata and one uniform is drawn inside each stratum. This guarantees
      coverage of the whole timestep range every batch and scales better than
      antithetic as batch size grows (variance ~1/B^3 vs ~1/B). Works for any
      batch size including odd. Only applies to the *base* uniform variate, so
      it composes with the deterministic distribution transform and any shift.

    Antithetic + QMC composition
    ----------------------------
    Unlike stratified, antithetic and qmc are not mutually exclusive: when
    both are set, ``batch_size // 2`` low-discrepancy points are drawn and each
    is mirrored as ``(u, 1-u)`` (for uniform/mode) or ``(z, -z)`` (for
    logit_normal/sigmoid, where ``z = logit(u)``). This "antithetic QMC"
    combines Sobol's space-filling property with pairwise variance
    cancellation, and is strictly better than either method alone in many
    settings. Odd batch sizes truncate the last mirrored pair. Only ``qmc``
    and ``stratified`` conflict (qmc wins); a warning is logged in that case.

    Args:
        weighting_scheme: One of "logit_normal", "mode", "uniform", "sigmoid".
            ("uniform" and "sigmoid" are accepted for the flow path; the SD3
            density originally only used logit_normal/mode/uniform.)
        batch_size: Number of sigmas to draw.
        logit_mean: Mean of the logit-normal base distribution.
        logit_std: Std of the logit-normal base distribution.
        mode_scale: Scale for the "mode" weighting scheme.
        antithetic: If True, draw mirrored base-variates pairs.
        stratified: If True, use stratified sampling on the base uniform.
        qmc: If set to "sobol" or "halton", use a low-discrepancy sequence for
            the base uniform.
        device: Device on which to generate the tensor. Defaults to "cpu" for
            backward compatibility with the original SD3 density, but callers on
            CUDA should pass the target device to avoid a host->device sync.
        sigmoid_scale: Scale of the normal base for "sigmoid" sampling.
        qmc_seed: Seed for the (scrambled) QMC sequence. Only used when ``qmc``
            is set.
        rank: DDP process index. When greater than 0, the QMC scramble seed is
            offset by ``rank`` so each rank draws from a different scrambled
            low-discrepancy sequence (no duplicate points across ranks, each
            still space-filling). Only used when ``qmc`` is set.

    Returns:

        Thin backward-compatible wrapper around
        :func:`compute_density_for_timestep_sampling` with ``antithetic=True``.
        New code should call that function directly.

    The batch is filled with mirrored pairs of the *base* randomness, and the
    configured distribution transform is applied identically to both members of
    each pair. Because the base variate of a mirrored pair (z, -z) or (u, 1-u)
    has the same marginal distribution as an i.i.d. draw, the batch remains
    marginally distributed according to the configured distribution while
    cancelling a large fraction of sampling variance.

    Supported distributions:
        "uniform":      u ~ U(0,1);           pair = (u, 1-u)

        "mode":         u ~ U(0,1) transformed; pair = (u, 1-u)

    Any downstream *deterministic* transform of sigma (e.g. the SD3/Flux shift
    sigma' = s*sigma / (1 + (s-1)*sigma)) may be applied afterwards and still
    respects the intended final distribution.

    Args:
