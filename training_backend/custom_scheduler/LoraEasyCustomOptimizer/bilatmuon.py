"""BilatMuon: mutual Newton-Schulz over two momentumized factors.

A gradient-descent optimizer that momentumizes the gradient and decomposes
the momentum into two matrices with different properties -- a left/column
factor A (m x r) and a right/row factor B (r x n) with an asymmetric
singular-value split M = (U Sigma^p)(Sigma^q V^T), p + q = 1, so one factor
carries more of the magnitude and the other more of the geometry -- then
crafts the update by orthogonalizing the two factors *against each other*
with a bilateral (mutual) Newton-Schulz iteration on the shared r x r
cross-Gramian, and finally composes the full update tensor.

The mutual orthogonalization is the novel part: for A in R^{m x r},
B in R^{r x n}, M = A B, the polynomial identity p(XY)X = Xp(YX) gives

    p(M M^T) M = A p(G_B G_A) B  =  M p(M^T M),   G_A = A^T A, G_B = B B^T,

so one joint substep with the *same* r x r polynomial P = p(G_B G_A) applied
on both sides -- A <- A P, B <- P B -- is exactly a Newton-Schulz step on the
full product M, computed at O(r^2(m+n)) instead of Muon's O(m^2 n). The
fixed point is G_A G_B = I (the factors are mutually balanced, not
individually orthonormal) and the composed update has a flat spectrum
(sigma = 1). AOL-Gram row-sum folding of each factor per substep stabilizes
the iteration and normalizes the top of the spectrum.

Two momentum architectures:

- mode "full" (default): a full m x n momentum buffer M <- beta M + (1-beta) G
  is the state; the momentum itself is decomposed fresh each step (exact SVD,
  randomized SVD -- 10-100x cheaper when the rank dial r < min(m, n) -- or an
  ALS warm-started half-sweep). With p = q = 1/2 the composed direction is the
  polar factor polar(M) -- a factored polar decomposition of the momentum;
  the update is lr * polar(M) (Muon-style unit magnitude: lr carries the
  step size, the momentum's scale steers the direction only, so the update
  cannot inherit the momentum's retained energy).
- mode "factored": the momentum lives in the two factor buffers (FacMuon
  style: the gradient is decomposed, each factor momentumized with its own
  poly-beta rate), and the mutual NS replaces FacMuon's independent
  per-factor orthogonalization.

Per step (2D+ parameters, gradient g in R^{m x n}, rank r):

0. Optional gradient preconditioning (eager, before the momentum):
   "sinkhorn" -- RMS Sinkhorn row/col balancing (each iteration divides
   every row by its RMS, then every column by its RMS, driving all row and
   column RMS values to 1), falling back to "rms" (whole-tensor division by
   the RMS) wherever Sinkhorn cannot apply: 1D/0D tensors or degenerate
   row/column marginals.

1. Full mode: M <- beta(t) M + (1 - beta(t)) g (poly-beta debiased).
   Factored mode: (a, b) = decompose(g) (SVD split or ALS half-sweep),
   sign-canonicalized, then m_A <- beta_A(t) m_A + (1 - beta_A(t)) a and
   m_B likewise with its own rate.

2. Decompose the momentum (full mode only): A = U Sigma^p, B = Sigma^q V^T
   with p + q = 1 (split hyperparam; the two factors have different
   properties by construction).

3. Mutual orthogonalization (ns_substeps = 2, the repo's pre-optimized
   cubic coefficient pairs): fold both factors, then per substep
   P = p((B B^T)(A^T A)), A <- A P, B <- P B.

4. Composition: delta = A @ B rescaled by a single scalar. Default: unit
   magnitude (Muon convention) -- the composed update is normalized to unit
   Frobenius energy (flat unit spectrum) and the step size lives entirely
   in lr, so retained momentum energy cannot sustain overshoot. Optional
   rescale_ortho=True: the update is rescaled back to the
   pre-orthogonalization product norm ||A @ B||_F (norm-preserving Muon;
   the norm comes from the r x r Gramians, ||A B||_F^2 = trace((A^T A)(B B^T)),
   so the m x n product is never materialized twice).

5. Cautious sign-flip update (novel variant): delta_i = sign(g_i)|delta_i|.

6. Cautious weight decay (flip variant): s_i = +1 where sign(p_i) ==
   sign(delta_i), else -1; decay = wd * s * p.

7. Stochastic bf16: the momentum/factor state is stored in bf16 with
   stochastic rounding on write (copy_stochastic_); fp32 master weights.

Memory: full mode = one m x n momentum buffer (bf16) + step (+ two r(m+n)
ALS warm-start factors); factored mode = exactly two factor tensors of
r(m + n) elements in bf16 + step. 1D/0D tensors use a plain poly-beta
momentum fallback with the same cautious machinery. All
heavy work lives in pure per-mode core functions that can be torch.compiled
(max-autotune) with an eager fallback; everything that changes per step
(betas, step) is passed as a tensor so the compiled graph never recompiles.

class BilatMuon(Optimizer):
    r"""BilatMuon: mutual Newton-Schulz over two momentumized factors.

    Args:
        params: iterable of parameters to optimize.
        lr (float): learning rate (default: 1e-2). The update is the
            mutually orthogonalized composition with a flat unit spectrum
            (all nonzero singular values ~1), so its RMS stays near O(1)
            regardless of gradient scale; the step size lives entirely in
            lr (unless ``rescale_ortho`` restores the pre-orthogonalization
            norm) -- treat lr as the tuning dial.
        mode (str): "full" (default) -- a full m x n momentum buffer is the
            state and the momentum itself is decomposed fresh each step;
            "factored" -- the momentum lives in two factor buffers
            (FacMuon-style, one poly-beta rate per factor).
        betas (Tuple[float, float]): poly-beta momentum rates. Full mode
            uses betas[0] for the momentum buffer; factored mode uses one
            rate per factor (default: (0.9, 0.95)). Debiased (poly = 1 at
            step 1, so the first step is a pure factorized-gradient step).
        weight_decay (float): decoupled weight decay (default: 0.0).
            Applied cautiously (sign-flip variant) by default.
        rank (int, optional): rank of the factorization (default: None =
            full rank min(m, n)). Smaller rank = less state memory (dial).
        factorization (str): "svd" (default, exact per-step SVD), "rsvd"
            (randomized SVD — the same (p, q) split and canonicalization
            at O(m n k) instead of O(m n min(m, n)); used when the rank
            dial r < min(m, n), where it is 10-100x cheaper, and routed to
            the exact SVD at full rank), or "als" (cheap SVD-free
            half-sweep; step 1 still uses the SVD/rsvd to seed the
            factors).
        rsvd_oversample (int): oversampling for the randomized SVD range
            finder (default: 8).
        rsvd_power (int): power iterations for the randomized SVD range
            finder (default: 1).
        split (Tuple[float, float]): asymmetric singular-value split
            (p, q) with p + q = 1 (default: (0.5, 0.5)): A = U Sigma^p and
            B = Sigma^q V^T, so one factor carries more of the magnitude
            and the other more of the geometry.
        ns_substeps (int): Newton-Schulz substeps for the mutual
            orthogonalization, cycling the repo's pre-optimized cubic
            coefficient pairs (default: 2).
        rescale_ortho (bool): rescale the composed update back to the
            pre-orthogonalization product norm ||A @ B||_F (norm-preserving
            Muon: orthogonalize the direction, restore the magnitude). With
            False (default) the update is normalized to unit Frobenius
            energy and lr carries the magnitude.
        cautious_update (bool): flip the sign of every update component
            that disagrees with the raw gradient instead of masking it
            (default: True).
        cautious_wd (bool): apply weight decay with a flipped sign wherever
            the decay would fight the update (default: True).
        stochastic_bf16 (bool): store the momentum/factor state in bf16
            with stochastic rounding on write (default: True). fp32 master
            weights are kept.
        quantize_grad (bool): stochastically round the raw gradient to bf16
            precision before factorization (default: False; unbiased,
            halves the factorization cost).
        precondition (str): gradient preconditioner applied before the
            momentum/factorization (default: "none"). "sinkhorn" -- RMS
            Sinkhorn row/col balancing (alternating row/col RMS
            normalization toward 1, ``sinkhorn_iters`` iterations; falls
            back to "rms" when it cannot be applied: 1D/0D tensors or
            degenerate row/column marginals). "rms" -- divide the whole
            gradient by its RMS (scale-only).
        sinkhorn_iters (int): iterations for the "sinkhorn" preconditioner
            (default: 5).
        als_eps (float): ridge regularization for the ALS solves
            (default: 1e-6). Relative to the gram trace (scale-aware).
        eps (float): stability constant for the Newton-Schulz folding
            (default: 1e-8).
        ortho_dtype (torch.dtype): compute dtype for the mutual
            orthogonalization (default: torch.bfloat16).
        compile_step (bool): torch.compile (max-autotune) the per-mode core
            functions, cached per shape, with eager fallback (default: False).

    State per 2D+ parameter: full mode = one momentum buffer (m x n, bf16 by
    default) plus a step counter (+ two r(m+n) ALS warm-start factors when
    factorization="als"); factored mode = exactly two momentum factor tensors
    (r(m + n) elements total, bf16 by default). 1D/0D parameters keep a
    single momentum buffer.
