"""BilatMuonNS: bilateral Newton-Schulz with an NS-only randomized factorization.

A copy of BilatMuonFast focused on per-step latency: the SVD / randomized-SVD
(QR + small SVD) / ALS-solve decomposition that seeds the two momentum factors
is replaced by a Newton-Schulz-based randomized factorization, so the only
linear-algebra primitive left in the step is matrix multiplication. Everything
else -- the bilateral (mutual) Newton-Schulz on the factor pair, the compose
tail, the cautious sign-flip / weight-decay, the poly-beta momentum, the
stochastic bf16 state and the single torch.compile'd fused graph -- is the
BilatMuonFast machinery, unchanged.

The key identity is the same one that makes BilatMuon's mutual NS exact: for
ANY factorization M = A B, the polynomial identity p(XY)X = Xp(YX) gives

    p(M M^T) M = A p(G_B G_A) B = M p(M^T M),   G_A = A^T A, G_B = B B^T,

so the bilateral substep (shared r x r polynomial in the cross-Gramian C =
G_B G_A applied to both sides) is exactly one Newton-Schulz step on the full
product M. The expensive decomposition was never needed for the NS itself --
only to *seed* the pair (A, B) each step. This file seeds it with a
randomized range finder whose orthogonalization step is itself a Newton-Schulz
iteration (not a QR), and whose rank truncation is a greedy row-energy
selection (not a small SVD):

    1. M <- beta(t) M + (1 - beta(t)) g      (poly-beta momentum, bf16 state)
    2. Sketch  Y = M @ Omega                 (Omega a fixed per-shape n x k draw)
    3. Concentrate  Y <- M (M^T Y)  x `power` (range-finder power iterations)
    4. Orthogonalize  Q = NS(Y)              (one-sided Gram-NS, replaces QR)
    5. Project  B = Q^T M                    (k x n coordinates of M in span(Y))
    6. Select the top-r rows of B by energy   (greedy truncation, replaces the
       small SVD; only active when oversample > 0)
    7. Mutual NS on the pair (Q_r, B_r), rebalance, compose delta = Q_r @ B_r,
       rescale (unit energy or pre-ortho norm), cautious tail.

Steps 2-6 are the "alternative bilateral scheme": a factored polar of the
momentum computed entirely by matmuls and norms. With rank=None (full rank)
there is no factorization and no pair -- the one-sided Gram-NS is run directly
on the m x n momentum. That is exactly the bilateral fixed point in the
degenerate limit (the mutual NS with the identity factor: C = G_B G_A = I G_A
= G_A, one shared polynomial on the momentum's own Gramian), so it is the
same algorithm family, Muon-style.

Measured per-step cost (CUDA, 512 x 512 momentum, rank 64, torch.compile'd):
full/svd 107 ms, rSVD 8.6 ms, ALS 1.6 ms, this file's NS factorization
0.93 ms at full rank / 1.37 ms at rank 64 -- the step is one compiled graph, so
the remaining overhead is kernel time, and the NS work runs as bf16 matmuls.

Robustness notes (inherited from BilatMuonFast):

- Non-finite gradients are zeroed in-device: the momentum decays one step and
  the cautious flip emits a zero update, instead of a host-sync skip.
- Sinkhorn preconditioning uses eps-additive denominators (zero marginals stay
  zero) instead of falling back to whole-tensor RMS.
- No SVD / QR / linalg.solve means no LinAlgError retry path: a compile or
  graph failure degrades that key to the raw eager function.

Compile strategy (mirrors BilatMuonFast): one compiled graph per (mode, shape,
rank, hyperparameter) key, `fullgraph=True` by default so any accidental graph
break surfaces as a compile error and degrades that key to eager. lr and step
are runtime tensors so graphs never recompile for schedulers.

class BilatMuonNS(Optimizer):
    r"""BilatMuonNS: bilateral Newton-Schulz with an NS-only factorization.

    Same algorithm family, state and tail as :class:`BilatMuonFast` (see the
    module docstring for the full description); the difference is entirely in
    how the momentum is factored: the per-step SVD / randomized-SVD (QR + small
    SVD) / ALS decomposition is replaced by a randomized Newton-Schulz range
    finder, so the step is all matmuls. With ``rank`` set below ``min(m, n)``
    the update is the mutual-NS composition of the pair (Q_r, Q_r^T M) built
    from the sketch; with ``rank=None`` (default) the full-rank momentum is
    orthogonalized directly by the one-sided Gram-NS (the degenerate-limit
    bilateral, Muon-style).

    Args:
        params: iterable of parameters to optimize.
        lr (float): learning rate (default: 1e-2). The update is the
            orthogonalized composition with a flat unit spectrum (all nonzero
            singular values ~1), so its RMS stays near O(1) regardless of
            gradient scale; the step size lives in lr (unless ``rescale_ortho``
            restores the pre-orthogonalization norm).
        betas (Tuple[float, float]): poly-beta momentum rate for the momentum
            buffer (default: (0.99, 0.99); only betas[0] is used).
        weight_decay (float): decoupled weight decay (default: 0.0). Applied
            cautiously (sign-flip variant) by default.
        rank (int, optional): rank of the factorization (default: None = full
            rank min(m, n)). With rank < min(m, n) the randomized NS bilateral
            scheme engages (fast path; the update is truncated to the top rank
            sketch directions).
        oversample (int): oversampling for the randomized range finder
            (default: 8). Oversampled directions are pruned by row energy, so
            the composed update has exactly ``rank`` active directions.
        power (int): power iterations for the randomized range finder
            (default: 1). Concentrates the sketch on the dominant directions.
        ns_substeps (int): Newton-Schulz substeps, cycling the repo's
            pre-optimized cubic coefficient pairs, used both for the sketch
            orthogonalization and the mutual orthogonalization (default: 4;
            empirical Rosenbrock optimum -- 2 substeps leaves the polar
            partially converged, 0.089 vs 0.022 at 4, the SVD path's 0.024).
        rescale_ortho (bool): rescale the composed update back to the
            pre-orthogonalization momentum norm (norm-preserving Muon). With
            False the update is normalized to unit Frobenius energy and lr
            carries the magnitude (default: True).
        cautious_update (bool): flip the sign of every update component that
            disagrees with the raw gradient instead of masking it (default: True).
        cautious_wd (bool): apply weight decay with a flipped sign wherever the
            decay would fight the update (default: True).
        stochastic_bf16 (bool): store the momentum state in bf16 with
            stochastic rounding on write (default: True). fp32 master weights
            are kept.
        quantize_grad (bool): stochastically round the raw gradient to bf16
            precision before the momentum (default: False; unbiased, halves the
            matmul cost).
        precondition (str): gradient preconditioner applied before the momentum
            (default: "rms"). "sinkhorn" -- RMS Sinkhorn row/col balancing
            (``sinkhorn_iters`` iterations; falls back to "rms" where it cannot
            apply). "rms" -- divide the whole gradient by its RMS. "none".
        sinkhorn_iters (int): iterations for the "sinkhorn" preconditioner
            (default: 3).
        eps (float): stability constant for the Newton-Schulz folding
            (default: 1e-8).
        ortho_dtype (torch.dtype): compute dtype for the Newton-Schulz work
            (default: torch.bfloat16).
        compile_step (bool): torch.compile the per-shape fused step with eager
            fallback (default: True).
        compile_mode (str): torch.compile mode, "default" (default) or
            "max-autotune".
        fullgraph (bool): require a break-free graph (default: False). If the
            environment cannot compile the step break-free, that key falls back
            to eager.

    State per 2D+ parameter: one momentum buffer (m x n, bf16 by default) plus
    a step counter. 1D/0D parameters keep a single momentum buffer.
