"""
Local launcher for Anima Studio's own training backend
(native_backend/, see native_backend/NOTES.md) - this module saves the
user from having to open a second terminal and run it by hand: given
the folder it lives in and the command to start it, it launches that as
a child process, tracks it, and can stop it again.

The default command runs native_backend/server.py using the *bundled*
backend's own venv Python (training_backend/sd_scripts/venv) - that's
what already has Anima training's dependencies installed (via "Set up
backend"), and native_backend's own SDXL-path dependencies
(diffusers/peft/etc, see native_backend/requirements.txt) get installed
into that same venv, so there's one venv to manage, not two.
training_backend/ itself is no longer something you run directly - it's
a library native_backend/anima_trainer.py imports from.

Deliberately simple: one backend process at a time, tracked in memory
(not persisted across an Anima Studio restart - if this process dies, any
backend it launched is treated as gone too, same as closing a terminal
window would). Settings (folder + command + auto-start) ARE persisted via
settings_store so they don't need re-entering every session.
